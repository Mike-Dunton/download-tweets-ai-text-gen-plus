i am very pro-life. i just don't think i can be a pro-life candidate. this makes me sad.
====================
By the time I finish this, they will have made millions of dollars off of my death. I am truly mad at them.
====================
I'm not a damn fashion show. I don't even care that you're doing an interview for the day. I'm still very confused.
====================
I dunno what that means but I am very close to 1500 followers and lovelovelove you guys. I would be very happy.
====================
I just realized that in the process of watching "I'm the guy with the dog" I've actually become the dude with the dog. I hate myself.
====================
@: you had to be online all night. You could not have done it with a face mask on. I'm not kidding.

====================
hahahahhaha
====================
I am not joking. Listen up. I know you are great and all but we gotta work on ourselves. We are a team.

When you are mad at someone for doing something stupid and you are mad at them for doing it, you are just as mad at them for doing it as they did. This is a huge difference. What are you mad at? You are mad at them for doing something stupid. Why did they do it?
====================
AHHHHHHH. I have made so many bad decisions in my life that I *would* not* be able to understand how someone can walk in a restaurant and order food. I would not be able to care. I would not be able to love. I would not be able to love the way I do. I feel like I am slowly breaking down and crying as I type. I am sad.
