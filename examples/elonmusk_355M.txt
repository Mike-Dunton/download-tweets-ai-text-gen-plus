Falcon Heavy on target for first launch from here on out
====================
<|startoftext|>🖤<|startoftext|>Love Oumuamua jokes<|startoftext|>I thought Twitter might try to block my personal account 🤗<|startoftext|>Btw, Price of the Model X is actually only $5k more than S. Lower cost/performance version coming later.<|startoftext|>That’s not just a typo, it’s a plea for help<|startoftext|>Tesla Q3 results: Model X orders, 13%, beat last 3 months<|startoftext|>Tesla received highest number of full refund requests in 3 years<|startoftext|>Why isn’t there more Kermit?<|startoftext|>Actually, S and X are the only two cars in North America that can refuel in highway while standing still<|startoftext|>This is a problem we’ve been working on for a while now
====================
I think sometimes when people think of Tesla, they think of sexy concept cars, but that is not always the case. The real magic happens when people see the car and think "Wow, this could actually work".
====================
You are my only hope. Please help.

Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle & truck next year
====================
Touchdown speed was good, altitude 915m, lateral distance 1300m, turn radius 13m. All good.

Falcon Heavy on defense for the coming year. It's a beast!

So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing, it's almost as if they're painting a giant | sledgehammer

I'm a believer in hyperloop, but only if you can convince a skeptical public.
====================
Press conference went really well. Kept saying Mass Effect 2 all the way through. Human-Covenant connection is just too damn interesting.
====================
Falcon lands, checks integrity of the A frame. Reentry heating elements should be healthy.

We had a long and interesting conversation on many subjects. He has exciting ideas for expanding Tesla into a billion-person company. His name is Robert and he’s mad at Tesla for releasing a car battery that leaked green!

As mentioned before, ship landings are required for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don’t affect flight dynamics.

And, since we’re at the beginning of the year, there’s a lot of free time in the meantime

Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla over the years. Thank you.

SpaceX has Boeing, Lockheed, Europe (Ariane) and Russia (Proton/Soyuz) near checkmate in rocket technology. End game is all about China.

For sure. Perhaps even more important that the political system in the US is broken. The media is too. And most of us are too.

Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is, we can tow this house around with a Model X!

Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.

As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.

Thanks, that's a great idea. I think it’ll work!
