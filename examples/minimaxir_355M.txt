It is the only way I can troll this blog post.

If it is not broken, I will not use it.

I will fix it however I have to manually parse the HTML and it is slow.

<|startoftext|>I have posted a link to the technical report on my blog, and I have been very pleasantly surprised by the number of comments and constructive criticism.

The big take away is that the strength of the feed is not what's important, it's the fact that the AI is improving at a rate that is *not* out of whack.

This is obviously a very strong argument for not using the automated sentiment generation feature, but given that it's a very new feature, I am

I really really want to see a MasterCard ad with that headline

The article is a good read in that it provides a good overview of the data science tools available and how they can be used to detect and understand spam. However, I personally found the article's conclusion somewhat misleading:

I just posted a pull request to the open-sourced gpt-2-simple 0.7 release and it looks like open-sourced fixes the bug that causes the regression to only happen when the input file is a string.

GPT-2-simple 0.7 *isn't* open-sourced, because I don't want to rip off/compile proprietary code in the process.

I have been looking into using Go to power a web crawler, but the cost/benefit analysis is hard to evaluate. (I'm assuming you don't have a data science background to analyze it)

you're so edgy

<|startoftext|>Fun fact: when building my own React/Redux apps, the default browser is Chrome.

I have a Chrome workaround for this though: install a different browser, open the default app, and then switch back to Chrome.

But there's a catch: if the current Chrome process dies, the process will restart in a few seconds, which is slow.

So I have a React component that will die if I try to use it in a web process, but it won

This is why startups should hire me for their   projects. I can fix their  stuff. :)
====================
This is the most pointless and shallow HR rep survey I've seen in quite awhile
====================

Hacker News is legitimately a place for drama.
====================
I'm not surprised that TechCrunch comments sections are getting a Make-Your-Own Layout!
====================
Wait, is there a way to get a list of tweets with the most-likes without actually reading the text?
====================
The worst part about doing your own hands-on reporting is that you're not allowed to do anything with it that isn't breaking the rules. Fortunately, I have a script to check for broken rules!
