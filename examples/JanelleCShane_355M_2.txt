The algorithm could be even more specific. In fact it could learn from the very first image on the internet.

In the early 1800s a Connecticut farmer named William Godwin planted a tomato vine that would one day turn black. The vegetable never did turn black, but the wheat it was supposed to eat turned black. That was the season. That was the season.
====================
I am intrigued that no one else is using this as a tutorial. Machine learning algorithms can do with some help from reading text.

Also interesting that the neural net seemed interested in clock towers and alps.

====================
So many amazing neural nets here at  ! So many datasets, so much talent. Home run derby at its finest.

====================
The neural network would sometimes generate completely nonsensical sentences. I.E. "A dog rode a spider."

While this is useful for teaching algorithms to generate new characters, it's not very useful for describing the world.

Maybe in the future it should be: "A dog walked into a room" or "A dog ate a bun".

Ye Olde English Text-to-Speech Recognition by His Majesty's Speech Recognition Team
====================
I tried to use   to get an explanation of these, but apparently it just happens to be the explanation they wanted.

From wikipedia:
"A curiosity-driven learning algorithm explores a set of labeled images, labeled images being a category in its own right. As the labeled images get more mysterious, the algorithm becomes more inventive, eventually leading to a state in which it is not guided at all."

They did manage to get the *real* inspiration for these, though. Apparently  is a lot like a 4-year-old.

From<|startoftext|>The takeaway here, though, is not to take inspiration from the internet. Instead, take inspiration from the human beings who have made it their mission to figure out how the universe works.

I suggest giving some serious thought to what XKCD is teaching you about neural networks.

For anyone who needs a break from all the Robot in the Kitchen
====================
I'm just getting started on the AI research dataset that was partly to blame for creating a neural network that did some of the work.

The learning curve was steep, to be blunt.

At some point, it became pretty good at guessing recipes, though.

It's also pretty good at this other, much grimmer, task.

I suspect it's good at guessing names, though.

I suspect it's good at guessing on names but - WAIT - alchemy?

I suspect it's good at both.

I suspect it can even guess on first names but not on titles or locations?
====================
Update: just informed by  that they're reading my blog. So that's that.

Thank you so much ! That makes my day.

You can play an AI music sequencer too. It just got much, much better.

A word from  : the new neural network recipes are some of my very favorites.

For the curious : here's a handy dandy (?) list of all the neural network's recipes.

Also : freshbaked beans, no bake, raisins, and cherries.

I suppose it's possible that word-rnn are just slightly more creative when given the option to generate new words.

Maybe they figure it's a good idea to give the A.I. the option of actually creating new words.

Or maybe they just invented the right words?

The neural network would categorically deny the existence of intelligent life on other worlds.

The only thing it could really agree on is that humans are *exactly* what they seem.

So it went with the saucer-riding prairie chicken.

In retrospect, when I trained a neural network to generate Christmas songs, I should have seen this coming.

<|startoftext|>It does seem a bit excessive to post a book with no index or footnotes when there are so many good examples online. But it's important to remember that this was all before search engines figured out how to generate them.

Plus,  this is the same index  that was used for the index of all the penguins.

This is why they're so anxious to see if some of the penguins are human.

Penguin flu? Admirable. Let's see if we can get some giraffes.

Giraffe? Not in the same category as the giraffes, but close. Let's see if we can get some peacocks.

The number of times a neural network has to invent new floorplans per day is minuscule compared to the number of times it has to invent new rooms per day.

The neural net is NOT that clever. it can't figure out that the  in the caption refers to the before-and-after image of your face.

it can, however, figure out that the  in the caption refers to the after-and-before image of your face.

i.e. the  in the caption refers to the after-and-before images of your face.

The problem with expecting AI to make good moral choices is that it's very difficult to tell what a bad choice actually was. In this game, the bad choices are never reversed.
====================
As if there weren't enough potential problems with this massive download.

Issue: the neural net REALLY got stuck in the mud.

Thankfully this neural net doesn’t work well in the real world.

In fact it made this attempt at reproducing psalms.

My daughter went to Wellesley College. It's in a bubble (but you can bike or pickerel)

My co-worker Tomislav Kudričkovski made this video with a neural network that was given text-based translation. It did a number on the old fashioned way to German, but it's really not up to English. (2:00)
====================
#WebBycommittee  : thank you so much for doing this!
====================
My practice is only with  and  , not  's page count. So in theory, it should be possible to limit the dataset to those two.

However,  's strict subsetming means that it's impossible to do that.
====================
When AI is asked to produce written text, it is less likely to produce nonsense than to produce written text. Here are fewer redundancies.

The distillery's website also mentions that "a few" years from now, someone will ask "when were the last times that a cask was empty?" and I will reply with a resounding "never".

The neural network is just getting started. It's compiling recipes and shit, and it's going to New York soon. #foodradio
====================
I guess so. It might learn to ignore the first 20,000 characters, but that's about it.
====================
This sounds amazing.

I just called mine. My book:
"What We Do in the Shadows: Essays on AI"
asked:: neural network, asked to rename cat, said "cat" 1st 2 lines, asked to leave a message; first 2 lines are from ME, on adoption, on leg, on soup kitchen staff, etc.

Then AI did cat next to me, and I was suddenly the happiest person in the room.
====================
I trained a neural network to generate Christmas movies, but not to mention Iron Man 3, The Avengers, or The Lord of the Rings. Which ones are you?
====================
The original GAN-based neural network training data was about as dense a b-tree as you'll find. It's a b-tree with points.

The same model added insult to injury by accidentally training its own image-causing algorithms.

One example that popped in my head: this neural net. It had generated food/drink pairings for a while, but the human connection was what drew them in.

In a strange twist of events, the dog biscuit is about to go terribly wrong.

I wonder if there's a similar neural network that adds punctuation to articles.

That's because I don't know of one that does that to anything else.

One thing I can think of is that there IS a distinctive pattern that precedes the punctuation.

I trained a neural network to generate new punctuation marks.

Here are a few of them.

The neural net did not create this. It was not trained on chess games, for example. It was not trained on Go, for example. It was not even chess-playing AI at all.
====================
The model-fitting algorithm  has a very unorthodox approach to hair.

It combed through existing images of human hair and decided on the  cutest/weirdest.

Of course it's subjective, but this is what we thought it saw as human hair.

It's also prone to noise, so it doesn't quite grab onto the 
particular hairsprink

H/T Bruce Preston for the suggestion
====================
The neural network trained on  already has a pretty good handle on the series of cat stories. In fact, it wrote the prologue. Which leads me to believe that it will be writing about cats as well.

The neural network already has a recipe recipe for this.
Serving suggestions: with bread, or w/o rye bread.
Ideally with no cheese or relish.

====================
Update: the neural network  is NOT that biased. It was trained specifically on text with a certain length.
Not sure what that length was, though. 500 characters? HAD IT.
1010 characters? BOUNCED.
1020+ characters? STILL HAVING PROBLEMS.
WORKAROUND: leave a short message!
====================
I have never regretted following this bot
====================
The neural network would answer questions like "what are balls made of?" or "is there a staircase to hell?" depending on what you ask it.

However, because I trained a neural network on questions about cats, I decided to see if the AI would be interested in questions about people.

So I asked it to train on questions about cats. It did just fine.

I think it was wondering why the heck not to when it said it did in fact try to answer questions about humans.

That's not to say that the neural network's recipes are entirely rational, however. It's one thing to write fan fiction based on actual recipes, but to do so while ignoring the thousands of other fantastic recipes is a bit rich.

I just called. Say hello to "Hard in the Beard Variety Throngeres on the Raider" and "Spread Flaming Throngeres on the Crabbe"
====================
The model trained on  and GAN2 took these two very seriously.

But the elephant in the room is the reason why the neural net was unable to see the humans' faces.

They couldn't see our eyes, because our hair and teeth are black.

They couldn't see our clothes, because our skin is black.

They couldn't see our hands, because our hands are black.

They couldn't see our feet, because our feet are black.

They couldn't see my cat, because my cat is black.

So the real reason the neural net was unable to see our faces is that we all wear the same outfit.

Hands, please.

The problem with ["Brain Stuff"] is that it doesn't quite have the hang of it's own. The tutorial videos do a good job of teaching it that there ARE rules, and that sometimes those rules need to be obeyed.

But the real talent here is in the thousands of lines of weird commentary that accompany the ruleset's most striking examples.

The neural net did not create these, of course, and the thousands of examples it provided did not, technically, exist. But the tools for visualising and graphing them are so much nicer than the thousands of lines themselves.

This is what tools for visualising and graphing neural net-generated fish would look like. There are no claws or spines or human faces or rats.

It would look like this:

It's completely plausible that a neural network would invent these. The only problem is, we don't know whether they'd let us see their work.
====================
The neural network's heavy lifting is being done by humans, but the results are sometimes a bit fuzzier.

Occasionally, though, as when I had to choose just one image from a huge pile to use as the background for a 2D game, the neural network was surprisingly good at it.

Sometimes it made the image play out better than I did.

Occasionally, though, as when I had to choose just one image from a huge pile to use as the background for a 2D game, the neural network was surprisingly bad at it.

Sometimes it made the image play out worse than I did.

I tried a few more random images and the neural net still had trouble with the bears.

====================
You could also build an AI that learned to read the human language. That's one approach.

Or learn to do other things besides read the text.

That's an entirely different approach.

Maybe the human-knitter thing was causing the problems with the original dataset, not the other way around.

I trained a neural net on "realistic human speech" and, well, it did make "realistic human speech" sound like it was a seriously messed-up croissant.

“Water from the Lochnagar to the Anando river is life-giving and nutritious”
====================
I like how, instead of just writing down what it sees as the most dangerous situation, it tries to figure out what humans might do in that situation. For example, in the simulator, a lion is depicted as a very dangerous situation, depending on your build, but a bear as a very dangerous situation, depending on your build and terrain type. So in the simulator a lion is depicted as a very dangerous situation, depending on your build, but a bear as a very dangerous situation, depending on your build, and terrain type.

I guess not. The neural network does understand "horse".

In fact, it made this amazing discovery

The neural network has no idea how electricity works. It thinks it does because "light is absorbed in a crystal and scattered like snow".

My labmate Qing Gu is quoted in this! So excited!

The article also mentions that this specific neural net was originally trained on two-year-old print versions of Nature, so it may or may not know that years ago they said to look for leaf litter near a fire. So it may or may not be looking for embers. Which are rare. And black holes.)

I think the best use for deep learning is in image recognition. IBM Watson can learn to distinguish humans from pictures of cats, for example.

Can't believe they didn’t think of that.

In case you were wondering who this algorithm's favorite Marvel character is, this is what happened when it was told to remove the "background"

My attempt at making a neural network learn to generate new cats and dogs.

Their names are Vaguely Distorting, but that's about it.

Their sizes are not important, as long as they're under 5'0" they'll do.

====================
<|startoftext|>In late October, just a few days after the election, a Russian troll started posting #shutdowntheAI messages to some of my favorite subreddits.

I used a neural network to try to reproduce the message-delivery/response behavior, and it was able to do so with remarkable fine-grained control. The archived GAN training set includes a huge amount of text that can & should be read as examples of this.

But alas, because the neural net was trained on Reddit, it saw all the text and reacted in predictable and disturbing ways.

It was particularly scary at low-to-mid-90s temps (though it also reacted unpredictably to -80s and below).

The only thing that seems to have changed is that at some point during the response, the temperature went up.

At that point, the human face really becomes conspicuous.

At that point, the AI starts to act weirdly.

<|startoftext|>Supposing I was to do a story in the near future set in 2031, what should it be about?

A bat colony is threatened by a swarm of giant rats. Bat colonies are ordered to create as many megastructures as possible.

Bat colonies develop into the largest, most complex structures. Some of them are brightly colored.

Eventually, as in real life, the bad guys win.

In "Assured Destruction: The Story of AI" (free sample), playwright & philosopher Ro Gellhorn imagines a world in which AI is not only bad but also inevitable.

At some point in the story, however, it decides to do good instead of evil.

In the end, it tries to use good intentions to help some people.

In the process, it forgets about some of the people it's hurting.

My favorite parts of a Comic convention are the parts I can’t share - the candid glimpses of costume & prop design.

A few notes before I continue:

a) this is a neural net, so it can' t possibly mean other things other than "cat" or "sand"
b) this neural net is NOT that good at "cat names"
c) there are lots of ways this list could go wrong, including the possibility that it's listing the wrong animals. And for some reason, it just assumed "cats" were the correct category.

<|startoftext|>I trained a neural network to generate Christmas movies, and they made their own.

They called their own cars too.

In fact they called a few of the cars from the video game.

The neural network ended up with a vocabulary so vast that even the vast majority of its movies didn't fill in all the blanks.

The result? This:

Movie(s) with and without the dog.

This is what #NaNoWriMo looks like. It’s wonderful. Look at the pretty flowers. They are TOO HARD to find
====================
The neural network I trained to generate cats and dogs would stop short at humans if that cat or dog were human.

At other times, it would become unusually friendly.

At other times, it would stop dead.

At other times, it would literally sing to drown out the background noise.

At other times, it would do all of these things.
====================
This sort of thing is exactly why, although I was excited to get this shirt, the "real" reasons aren’t in the "bad" category.
====================
The neural network would accept no credit for the things you do with it. You are not a scientist until you tell the neural network what a car is and why it is a car.

A human would reject your training data forever unless you told it to add a feather to a bird.

The article also mentions the oft-discussed "double-dipping" problem, in which two neural nets try to combine their data for a picture. 
"The researchers said they were surprised it managed to combine the two types of images - given how similar they were drawn to each other, it was likely doing so to some extent."

Not the first time i've heard of this, though. Common malady affecting a lot of datasets: underfitting, unmeasured-difference, etc.

I trained a neural net on 91,000 US cases, and in no way do i believe this to be a joke.

Here's a list of some of the weird things it found.

Is there a difference between a neural network and a neural network with text?

My own bot-generated novel is called The Raven in the Dark. Can you tell?

... your browser, at least, doesn't support the "online book club" feature. You can try to use one of these, though:
====================
The new [[Create An Avatar|]]. Find your inner geek and play it safe.
====================
Actually the neural net could be even weirder. It found the cake recipe to be "fart" until the end, at which point it switched to "cat" or "submarine" depending on the ingredient list. See below.
====================
The neural network learning to generate news articles based on text strings.
This is a bit troubling because it seems to be telling the time machine story all wrong.
====================
I wonder if there's a similar machine learning library for image recognition. A neural network might be able to write storybooks like this.
====================
Donated to a few different causes, here are a few more reasons why you should give some thinking to the neural network's aesthetic.

The Last Jedi was great fun, by the way. Thanks, Campbell.
====================
Supposing I was to do a crochet version of Shark Tank. Which  would you want to see in the water?
====================
a neural network is not a jello salad, per se
but it sure can be worse

It looks eerily like an old hunting lodge.

<|startoftext|>Here's a couple of the neural nets that Wretched Crayola dreamed up. The lions are humans, the bears are horses, etc.

The sheep are now at large.

The ai-generated map only included lions, so it didn't take into account the fact that some species have sharp feline teeth or claws.

In fact, the ai thought the entire planet were cats until it was told there were sheep.

The ai was originally trained on pages linked from the internet, so it has never seen an actual webpage.

But it has huge memory and can remember lion cubs crying.

It can remember sheep crying.
It can remember a cat crying.
It can remember a dog crying.
It can remember a person crying.

It can even remember a plane crashing into a building.

It can remember a building collapsing around them.

But not a single building being here. Not a single

If you ask Visual Chatbot to generate new names for existing animals, it does a pretty convincing job of it.

In fact they're not that different from one another in style and content. The only real difference is textgenrnn's propensity to generate nonsense text.

That may or may not be a bug.

<|startoftext|>A quick look at the top-rated and most-downloaded books on Amazon tells us quite a bit about the kinds of books these algorithms are.

Looking specifically at the top-rated, we can see that this algorithm really got into the habit of downclicking when it saw text with an unusually high-traffic word count.

By "oddity", I don't mean that it was doing this deliberately, but it was.

The algorithm also noticed that some words in the title were downregistered, so it decided to do the same for the rest.

The resulting list was strangely verbose.

I guess the upside is that it can be of use to writers who often have to deal with extremely high-traffic text.

Still, the downside is that it can also be used to generate entirely new, extremely verbose, and unwieldy C-3PO dialogue.

The only reason I didn’t give it an ☆ is because I don’t normally publish authors whose work I'm interested in.
But it turns out it’s possible to get other people to publish books with their stories, even if you don’t tell them what the book is about.
Plus, it's formatted like a book.

The neural network wouldn't stop repeating the same corny knock-knock jokes, so it went with the more mundane material.

By "hamburger" I mean a sandwich that includes cheese, and possibly meat. (Actually it just included beans, which are cheap.)
====================
I think the most telling example is a neural network that learned to generate puns based on text. It did this amazingly well at it's first job. Now it's so bad at anything else.
====================
The neural network would #shutdowntheAI
====================
I am intrigued that no one has pointed out the similarities between the neural net I used for generating names and badges and the badges we use to identify our researchers. (via  )
====================
Supposing I were to do a crochet version of 'Saw What?' Would you mind sending me a copy of the book you wrote about that?
====================
We are no strangers to neural networks inventing new languages and cultures. But this one's a bit different. Pronunciation, on the other hand, seems to have a HUGE bearing on sentence structure.
====================
The only reason I didn't think of this is that the neural net I'm on right now has no idea how to do math. It's like trying to explain gravity to a foghorn.
====================
Anna, do you have a p.s. I would be interested in your answer. Thoughts?

====================
The neural net is NOT that good at dating.

at least   isn't that bad at it yet.

i don't know how to fix that.
====================
I trained a neural network to generate new names for fireworks. Here are a few of my favorites.
New England Patriots - Pokéwick
====================
A friend of mine has one that's an 1848 printing. This is the year it stopped printing, though. Unidentified source?
====================
the book! It is so much fun so far only a few minor quibbles remain

the incisive take on AI and human kindness

a bit on the esoteric side (- in a good way)
====================
I am thinking more deeply about this issue. Favor one culture over another. Please help!
====================
“The beauty of the neural network is that it can do almost anything a human can do.”
====================
I am interested to see if there is a BLAST event that would trigger this. Any chance you could post a list of the events via
====================
There was a woman in my life who had the unfortunate experience of being followed by a bear while hiking in the Sierras. I think she read my index and figured I was a writer. I was wrong. She is a bear.
====================
Now up to 70+ titles, some NSFW. Last year:
====================
Any chance you could try to send an email when  publishes tomorrow's  line? I bet it'll be in the hundreds of formats I can try.
====================
The neural network is not that good at 
  at   is  at 
it just doesn't like 
lots of the  classes are syntax errors though
====================
She wrote some of my favorite books, and wrote me two very kind notes when I was in college. I'm honored to have shared a planet with her.
