This is one of my favorite neural network sounds. Like a bellwether.
====================
I trained a neural network on the ten thousand most frequently-entered  titles.

Here are the most commonly-entered movies.

====================
I would love to reprint a figure from a 1998 proceeding in my upcoming book:
====================
I trained a neural network to generate new names for fireworks, and they showed a disturbing tendency to revert to more primitive firework designs.

These were mostly because the neural network had already learned all the firework designs.

One notable exception: this image.

➜Fireworks are forbidden in the Skinner Box
====================
People are suggesting other ways to do this - for example, by running a neural network through taxonomies. Any chance you could help out with a dataset for a potential future book?
====================
In retrospect, when I trained the neural network for a living, this was one of the most depressing times.

I wish I'd known what to expect.
====================
See you there!

I have the most recent of the two neural net created ball caps, thanks to  . The word "bog" is written in big black letters. "Not fancy"
In retrospect, when I trained a neural network on Halloween costumes, I should have seen this coming.
====================
An abundance of other possible explanations. For one: neural network spike suppression. For another: I-90 in particular. (1/2)

My friend Kelly Manley made these for the St. Patrick's Festival.
They were soadorably sweet.

I'm just now noticing the pattern of fish species that pop up in the news. These could be your friends. Or the next set of #PlushGiraffeFishingPerturbations
====================
I used   to illustrate the neural network's favored Halloween costumes. The "real" costumes are in bold.
Candy Hearts for the brave.(?!)
====================
The neural network would never, ever do that. Ever.

They'd never forgive you. Never. Fucking. Allow it
====================
I just called. Say hello to "Hard in the Beard Variety Throngeres on the Raider" or "I Love You, Campbell" depending on your mood. Callers to my mom's  in Alaska get a personalized story about a boy they didn’t choose but are very happy about.
====================
“We now have a fully functioning neural network that can generate new cake recipes.”
====================
Conceptually, it's a lot simpler than that. A bunch of arrows pointing in the same direction make the book's text more legible.
====================
The neural network has other ideas about what humans are.

in particular, it sees snakes as a kind of cool animal.

First appearance of a neural network animal in the NYTimes. Then, for the umpteenth time, it appears to be writing about something other than humans.

At least it tried.

at least it tried hard enough.

i don't know how long it had been trying to write about something else until the cows started writing about it.

i don't either.

The neural network trained for a month on 82 million Amazon product reviews.
41% of reviewers endorsed this cereal.
35% of the time, the ~full-text description was completely blank.
21% of the time, the ~full-text description was completely, 100% wrong.

This sounds like a blast from my youth! Like working on valve or something.

I used to do a bot at work that would generate stories for us to read afterwards.
====================
<|startoftext|>The model learns to look like a human being if you ignore the pretty much everything else about them. It has learned to use pretty much everything else to describe humans.

At some point, though, the humans get too familiar. The laser twitches, the human face contortions, the whole shebang become second nature to the neural net.

At some point, though, the humans get too familiar. The neural net starts looking more and more human. At some point, though, the humans get too familiar.

The beauty of deep learning is that it can do almost anything - that's why it's fascinated by wheels.

It discovered that a wheel does not a train make, but rather a series of blocks stacked on top of each other.

So a train of 1 blockcars does not a train make, but rather a series of stacked blocks.

- this is why they call them "holey barn"

The neural networks I've trained on the internet are bad at this. Most of them are.

But this one?

(Tried to train this one too, using the same data, but x =10 is bias)
====================
<|startoftext|>I see nothing wrong with this 100% peer-reviewed academic research paper that was part of a conference on overfitting.

It was part of a conference on presentation biases, so it got *me*

But it's not like presenting a duck with a lion's tooth meant you could *actually* present a duck without a tooth

it just so happens that presenting a duck without a tooth is more aesthetically pleasing

One of the problems with the neural network's poetry is that it tends to repeat the same basic plot elements.
One example:
====================
No JavaScript? We need you! Add here some weird C++ code and we'll post a neural net-generated article for you.
====================
I like how, while the neural network tried to reproduce patterns in the real world, it also tried to generate new  titles based on those patterns. (Incidentally: Thats Angela Bassett)
====================
My old software did not make the software binary, but it did make it debug output that was more coherent.

Nowadays it doesn't work on .NET now, but it did on .NET 1.1.

That's not to say that it didn't work on .NET 1.1 - there was a time when it was possible to do that.

However, it appears that the "good" systems do in fact learn to do the "right" things - at least when it comes to avoiding capture.
What's more, they seem to learn this from watching and copying others.
I suspect this strategy will be especially useful in non-human skiers

animal conservation.

human health.

environmental science.

*anthropology* is short for "anthropology of animals" but in this context it's really good at referring to other kinds of studies. So if I'm lucky enough to run into you, I'm happy to share a few prawns.

My old research group is also looking for alumni who might have helped run some of these experiments. If you're a researcher, I'd love to talk to you!

====================
The model also learned from experience. People with pre-existing health conditions were less likely to be served by a model with an existing medical condition.

And no, AI isn't *asking* for your medical records or anything. It's just asking for *what's in the best interest of the patient*.

Which is why, oddly, the most aggressive AI is also the one least likely to steal.

People with existing medical conditions (and especially pre-existing conditions) are much less likely to be served by an AI with a history of stealing.

People with no medical history are much less likely to be served by an AI with a history of stealing.

So if I was going to use neural networks for text generation, what the hell would be the best thing to do?

Well, first: don't take the bait.

Second: don't take the unskilled labor of a neural network.

And finally: don't take the unskilled labor of a neural network--or the unskilled labor of a computer, for that matter--and use it to create useful, not useless, AI text.

Not that it's unskilled, mind you. AI did all of that work for you.

But it IS unskilled, and it tried its best.

The way neural networks work is that they don't really know what they're doing. They can do a lot of damage.

But you can stop them if you keep telling them to do something.

The neural net has written some of the worst human stories.

It is, after all, human.

But just a few short years ago, the US government tried to warn the public about a deadly virus outbreak caused by a single DNA virus.

In The Last Station, Antarctica, the government releases a television ad warning of a deadly virus outbreak within an hour.

The ad appears to have worked.

<|startoftext|>And it’s worth noting that while neural net cocktails have been making news lately, they're not the first time AI has meddled in the mix of ingredients.

At least, not the first time it tried.

from<|startoftext|>Here's another neural net cocktail recipe, this time made by a woman who insisted on including mozilla in the recipe. I assume it was expecting chicken? Or should I say duck?

Mozzarella? Toffee?

I dunno, I'd try it. Who knows?

from<|startoftext|>I like this idea: if a neural net is given the choice between two ingredients, it will choose the more mundane but potentially more dangerous.

Strangely, though, it seems to really like the more mundane the better.

a few corrections: first, that Star Wars is not literally about that many planets. It's about that many *different* ways to get to that *point*. second, that I trained a neural network to generate new characters, but that's not how Twitter characters work.

When AI is asked to minimize its own harm, it usually tries to minimize the harm its users do.

But sometimes its own users do harm, and that's when we should ask what it can do to help.

Aka: ask us to minimize its own harm.

Aka: ask us to minimize the harm of other users.

Aka: ask us to minimize the harm of the article itself.

Aka: whatever works.

The model also learned from the Wikipedia article on the given target, so it can be fairly confident it's talking to a real person.

The Wikipedia article is, of course, just one of the many examples of biased training data that's made it into products we use everyday.

The GAN also has the potential to generate  lines and  sticky note  lines.

Imagine the  lines if they were SCIENCE not LOL

Also, bear in mind, this neural net was originally trained on pages 1-10 of  

So it's not that it was biased, just that it had no idea what was going on after page 10.

That's the page number on the original paper that  linked to.

Used 's colab output to get at least part of the page number, as well as to get at least part of the author's name.

Results are there because of a bug in the way that the book is text-based.

Here's another neural network attempt at naming balloons. The human balloonist is conspicuously missing.

The pix2pix feature vector fits perfectly to the 300+ balloon models in the dataset, so this one was a smooth copy.

There's one model in particular that's particularly interesting, the time capsule model.

The  at the top is scale invariant, so it can do either way you want it to do.

There's also a window pane model, but that's technically a window glass.

I guess you could try to pry it off the glass, but that's not how they do it in the US.

Instead they just stuck a piece of clear Plexiglas over the edge and called it a day.

They did manage to get one other balloon off the ground though.

Imagine if it’s English or American football.

Imagine if it was a real simulation...

Imagine if it was not attacking you from behind, but was instead trying to get at your Wicket...
====================
Does anyone know the word for the type of sentence fragment that's like "Has five cats and wizard powers" or "Will not tolerate toast"?

At least Watson is sensitive enough to detect a  sliver of human hair  that's not metal.

The neural network trained on  already has a pretty good handle on the series, but the new  makes it all the more fascinating.

When I trained the neural net on Disney/Sleuth, there was this one scene.
Then there were many.
I trained a neural network on a mix of Disney/Sleuth and non-Disney/Sleuth scenes, and found this one to be the most disturbing.
Came across this scary-looking performance somewhere before.
Handsome, right?
i am charmed.
====================
What's more, the neural network consistently failed to predict the text.
One example: "'Tis of a gone way, methinks' is not what it seems."
Conceptual framework: googl
====================
The neural network  trained on  drew this for me. For science!
====================
Those who donate $100 or more will get a Steve-O comic book personalized by an AI researcher. For some reason, this was a huge hit with the  crowd.

Thoughts on a neural network that's learned to generate poetry.

My favorite part:
 
What else: fish sauce, bread, and... weird neural net poetry?
====================
The neural network is NOT that good at

I just called mine! My call is:

1) NBA PLAYOFFS
2) NHL PLAYOFFS
3) FUTURE FOOTBALL SEATS
4) ALL FOOTBALL
====================
The neural network trained on the same text so it can't possibly be any more confusing.
H/T RobustBits for the lead.
Bot w/o text probably means similarly situated but slightly more dangerous

Just did this - left a message. Will try again later.

Just left a message.

To which one of these would you rather it?
====================
I was 6 and it had:
1. an old-fashioned way to get to the pumpkin patch (the one in the picture)?
2. a route that went all the way to the pumpkin patch?
3. a route that saw snow for 48 hours straight?
====================
So, I guess not. A neural network could produce the same sentence, but the first line of the script it read was "was a wealthy, famous, ancient, and powerful person" rather than "were you there to see a play?"
====================
I am a neural network mathematician, and this is the coolest thing
====================
The neural network predicts the  lines will be of the "right" variety, and yet these are the lines the  trained neural network generated.

I’ll add “depressing echoes” to the list of sounds caused by radiation.

====================
I am curious to see how others deal with this. I would be curious to know what sort of weird things other people do with this data.

Also interested in: future of work, grad school applications, etc

Hint: It could be very strange indeed
====================
There was a trade-off. On the one hand, big data allowed the creation of highly detailed 3D objects, but on the other, it caused headaches for the designers who had to manage the incredibly detailed 3D models themselves.

Computer-generated cats vs human-rendered cats
====================
In addition to the trees, giraffes also have horns. Now in the possession of a badass  researcher!
====================

 gpt-2 was originally trained on data from  , but with some extra tweaking from
====================
It's a VCR4 as far as I can tell. An early build of Cray's gear. Beret, knees up, holstered. Not sure if this is a good sign or a bad sign.
====================
One thing about AI: it can't be thanked enough.
Reddit/Facebook: remember when we had r/awlias too?
====================
It's just going to get much worse. #ICantBreathe
====================
But really, this is about more than just AI. Machine learning makes non-human animals and humans very well-equipped to deal with adversarial attacks. —Handsome endearments: "I love you so much." "I trust you." "I'll do anything for you."

In other words, given the choice, most humans would choose the latter.

Plus, given the choice, most machines would choose the former.
====================
I also tried to generate sell-by dates for drinks, and boy oh boy was that hard. A bear of epic proportions? A building engulfed in flames? A star in the sky?

Gotta hand it to 's user: she made this one really easy.

As someone who has OCD, I find this particularly galling. And I'm guessing that for some people with PTSD, it's not just about the images, but also the people.
====================
Your neighbor is a creep. Your city is a ghost town. Your country is a 700-year-old civilization on a frigid seafloor.
====================
And the neural network's music is, as far as I know, the first and only recorded music to be composed entirely of synthesized notes.

Incredibly rare indeed.
====================
The  folks have been GREAT! Responding so quickly & strongly to just a few examples. Huge thanks. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017

Everyone is going to this! Tickets are $10 (plus fees and/or taxes) and there are always people who RS who get in.

Pls suggest people skip the awkward small talk and get to the meat of the issue rather than just reading the summary.

Thanks so much, everyone!
====================
Supposing I trained a neural network to generate cookbook recipes... what should it invent as its own ingredients list? (via  )
====================
In retrospect, when I trained a neural network on the list of all wikipedia titles, I should have seen this coming.
====================
I'm training this neural network on 10k novel first lines, and for some reason it really really likes the  line about the cuckoo's child.
====================
I would classify this book as a children's book, but that's technically apples and oranges
====================
These neural net-generated bird names are WEIRD (as in: extremely unusual) by now. Who knew?
====================
But I guess the solution to this problem isn't to make it ask for anything.
I suppose that's possible, but I don’t know how.
One possibility is that the neural net was trying to ask "For what?" when it was asked to generate Christmas carols, but as it turns out, it's pretty good at that.
====================
I am thinking of ways to do this. Any favorites?
====================
Looked at the GAN's output of 's  and it is, without a doubt, the most beautiful video game interface ever. Ever. Period. Stop messing with game gancat 

For more on Game Cats and other prototypes, check out this thread on arXiv.org:
====================
The idea that we could turn on the magic carpet and magically turn any object into a book or a statue seems very much like science fiction.
====================
in fact they did detect some structure to some of the images, but only in a very approximate way. the neural net did invent a whole new class of buildings, after all
====================
Using only the output categories from Google Cloud Vision, I was able to change a few things up their appearances. Most notable: the cave-dwelling ogres have gained the ability to change form (though technically they can still do damage & CUTTING THROATS).
====================
It's a VCR4. I played it through a simulator to make it explain the gaps better. It worked!

I'm training these neural net cat dogs on  from now on. They'll never, ever, ever, ever, cat poop in the same sentence twice.

After I published the article on the neural network who wrote the Pokemon books, I got a flurry of messages from people who wanted to tell me how their books did. Some of you’re real, and some of you’re not. 

How did you two manage to get so lucky?
====================
That's not to say that neural networks are always right. Sometimes they fucking are. Sometimes they're just plain wrong.
====================
It really is a walk in the park, doesn't it?
Supposing I filled in some blanks with my own observations and that some of my colleagues and I were to explore them in the journal Psychological Science?

I don’t want you to go hungry
====================
My neural net was originally trained on pages linked to on reddit, so this is like coming home to roost.

I really like this idea: "a woman is standing in a kitchen with a dog." Who is the dog? Probably not the cat, since the dog is freaking everywhere. What is the woman doing? Presumably she is making food or maybe even getting back to the car. Who is the cat? As far as I know the cat is also making food, but the dog is still freaking everywhere.

<|startoftext|>In a strange twist on “robots are coming for my job,” some tech companies that boast about their artificial intelligence suggest they might try to steal recipes from humans.

Technically, they're correct that way - AI might try to do that’ but that's not the same as actually trying.

Instead, they’re training a new AI to do the recipe research, which is why their notes are mysteriously blank.

Technically, they’re correct that way - their notes are mysteriously blank.

Eventually the neural net wrote to itself.

At first it wrote to  and me, and then to the moon.

At moonrise, I wave to the assembled workers.

You are WRONG about math.

at least you weren’t WRONG about physics.

This sounds really good. Bought the bundle.
====================
<|startoftext|>The scientific method, or at least the "best" version of it, is a terrible strategy for any number of reasons.

But the neural net's version of the "best strategy" is to try to apply that very strategy to the problem at hand.

That's what they did here.

They called each other. They called their senators. They called the president.

They all had a Diet Coke or two.

Then, one by one, they called their representatives.

This was their process.

I trained a neural network to do the same thing, only with people instead of offices or states.

It called their offices.

They called their senators.

They called their presidents.

Finally, they called their governors.

They called their secretaries.

They called their acting attorneys general.

They called their DPs.

They all had a Diet Coke or two.

<|startoftext|>The idea that AI is somehow going to be good at *everything* is a fallacy. At least, it's a fallacy on the most basic level.

AI can do pretty much anything if you let it.

At some point, probably somewhere along the line, someone *did* let it try to do *everything*.

The difference is, someone *did* let it try to do *everything* with *as many colors as there are words.

The takeaway message? *always remember* the *bigger* the better the recall.

You can play with the generator yourself, or read the paper for yourself.

In the latter case, I generated a bunch of new words and re-ran the training set with the new definitions.

The reason why neural networks are good at this is that they are bad at many things. They are good at generating images, sounds, and smells. But bad at generating text.

This sort of thing is exactly why, despite the fact that neural networks are supposed to be good at this sort of thing, they sometimes make boring books.

In fact, they sometimes make books that are worse at this sort of thing, because they don't take human interaction into account.

In other words, they don't take human input into account when they generate stories.

Strangely, though, they seem to really like to do interactive games.

In fact, they seem to really like to do first-person shooters.

In other words, it's saying that because my predicted items are always the same, and even though I'm constantly changing them, they are never the same.

I tested this by having a neural network generate new NBA teams, and NHL teams, and football teams, and rugby teams (and, oddly, asexual robot bikinis). I labeled the teams according to a neural network's output of their nicknames.

In fact they did something similar with  in their training data.

Not sure why all the examples of kitten names are so depressing.
====================
What I really want to know is, "What do you call a sparrow by its feet?"
====================
My former  labmate Qing Gu is quoted in this! 
====================
At least Watson can see into the past.
====================
The neural network can also do names for cats and dogs.

The  neural network also invented new cats and duds.

The  neural network also invented new dogs and sweethearts.

So, the recipe that was supposed to be "only vegan cheese" turned out to be vegan cheese with tomatoes, peppers, and peas. Flavor: nutty, with a hint of sweetness. —Bethany

The neural network doesn't stop there. It does a lot more sophisticated work than just generating words.

The formula is:

x + y^2

where x is the area under the car, and y is the area over which the car is driven.

In retrospect, when I trained a neural network to generate Christmas carols, I should have seen this coming.
====================
The neural network will usually stop short of outright malicious behavior, but it's worth remembering that adversarial attacks do occasionally result in harm.

At least, that's the theory.
====================
This bot posts %s funny cat videos and other occasional gems all over the internet.

It's free (as in beer) and always has been free.
====================
When I trained a neural network to generate news articles, things got a bit more terrifying.
====================
My copy of Inbublious is in its customary pristine condition!

As far as I **know** there have been no broken shards, no oozing, or clumps of dust.

However, due to a hardware malfunction (probably related to my copy's poor condition) some of the pixels were inadvertently blacked out.

Of all the neural network-generated sports, the one that's about as unexpected as it is thrilling is the one in which the refs are humans.

That's because they're usually wrong.

It works by seeing how well the model can predict the text.

So for each  there is a 50/50 chance the text will be the same. Which is to say, it will be the same twice.

Which means it can predict the **same** text 200% accurately.

Which is to say, it predicted the **same** text 200% accurately.

Which is to say, it predicted the **same** text 200% accurately.

====================
The Law of Unintelligible Numbers by  is one of my favorite things ever.
"There are no equations that can be written by a computer"

The neural network would reply to any question with a story about a time it solved it. It usually ends up with a happy ending.
====================
I would implore you to read the original paper before deciding to read this. There are a LOT of spoilers.
====================
The neural net will generate a  to go with any phrase.

The  in the title are some of the most creative, hilarious, and thoughtful   sentences.

The  in the body are some of the most mundane.

In fact, they're probably the most mundane lines of all time.

In an ironic twist of events, a computer model predicted the tower would collapse at some point. Instead, it's flourished.

h/t  for the link
====================
The neural network would stop there, but it doesn't. Instead, it tries many different  lines.

One line it tried, and stuck with it.

That's the line they stick with.

It sticks with that for a while.

Then it goes with the current line.

The neural network's non-stop loop is one of the most disconcerting parts of the sequence.

Part of what makes it so disconcerting: the fact that it’s based on math.

====================
The neural network probably did not create humans. But it sure as heck helped.

The neural net did not make this movie, but it sure as heck helped.

In fact, it did much of the heavy lifting.

Movie not found if you try searching for "what movie?" or "when I was a kid" in Google.

I trained a neural network to generate new names for fireworks. Here are a few of my favorites.
(algorithm:  )
====================
Here's a couple of the hats. The "oh god" and "quack" hats. The "I'm an engineer" hats.

The "I know how the gears work" hats.
The "but I'm not an engineer" hats.

The "but I'm a programmer, so I get to customize the neural net's hair, eyes, and nose" hats.

The "But I'm a programmer, and I know how the hats work" hats.

The "but I'm a programmer, and you can't get a 'but' out of the 'but'" hats.
====================
I trained a neural network to generate new names for fireworks, so here are fireworks with names that the algorithm didn’t predict.

I predict that this feature will become essential in the near future
====================
the code is actually pretty self explanatory. just in case you were wondering why the AIs  and bell curve think a cat is a dog.

ai also did some fancy lights and particle systems to make them play more games. they still don't get it.

The neural network has also learned to generate names of animals.
It uses a first approximation, but that doesn't make it better at it.
(via  )
====================
I guess not. Here's the original paper with a bunch of weird edits.
(one imagines it was a book)
====================
The neural network would change the subject of any given sentence. It learned by doing, not by telling us what to think.

In other words, it learned to respond to the "what" question not with "I" but "why?".

Even "how" doesn't really answer the question.

It did not print its  message in the linear fashion that you might expect from a neural network. Instead, it used a technique called "inverse text generation".

then as the dogs descend, the skiers rise to take the dogs

then the dogs come back, lick their wounds, and go to work

the skiers come around, lick their wounds, and go to work again

the skiers come around, lick their wounds, and go to work again

the skiers come around, and the dogs start licking their wounds

the dogs keep coming, and going, and coming

<|startoftext|>Adversarial attacks: not what we were expecting. But we were wrong about the neural network.

From a practical point of view, the biggest advantage of having an AI over humans is that it can do more interesting things.

Human creativity: that's what it tried to do with the cake.

From a technical point of view, the biggest difference is probably in the training data. From that one particular training point, the AIs had better ideas about how computers work.

From a pedagogical point of view, the biggest difference is probably that the algorithms are trying to do the same thing.

From a marketing point of view, the biggest difference is probably that the algorithms are trying to sell you a product instead of a service.

From a research point of view, the biggest difference is probably that the algorithms are trying to do the same thing but on a much grander scale.

From a chatbot perspective, the biggest difference is

At its core, Machine learning is just a bunch of nerds playing video games. As such, it's a silly AI that’ll occasionally get weird.

However, it's also worth pointing out that while Machine learning has learned a great deal about text, it still doesn’t understand how sentences work.

So it can’t help but be weird sometimes.

And sometimes it tries to use weird image recognition algorithms to fill in missing blanks in the story.

I'm on  right now! Waiting for the fish to growl.

I find the neural net's "cat" and "dog" formats both unsatisfying, even if I try to combine "cat" and "dinosaur" into "haddock"

and "bread" into "sandcastle"

I have nothing against bears. Alligators, snowmen, flamingos - whatever floats your boat. — Jack at TED

The bears TED describes as "tall, aggressive, and lumberjack-like" are actually quite tame. Although the lumberjack is a bit taller. And...well, it is a lumberjack.

The bears TED doesn't publish times when they were slow enough to see a human face.

They do reveal that they have an advanced copy of some human face formats.

But they also publish papers that claim to have solved the riddle.

The neural network trained for a month on 82 million Amazon product reviews, and now knows all about The Lord of the Rings.
====================
Here's a more-detailed summary by  of the paper:
====================
The paper's conclusion:

"Our results are in no way to suggest that the neural network model is, ipso facto, better at, um, deep learning."

Which is, um, interesting. I wonder if there's a similar but quite different approach to adversarial attacks?
====================
You are WRONG about BASICS.
In fact you are much more WRONG about life.
Seriously read my other posts to get a better idea of what I'm talking about.

I have not used Flaming Text since its initial public beta, but it does appear to have a text-based AI.

Here's how it responded to "What are the ten most dangerous animals?"

robot(s) with fire in the belly

robot(s) if you don't eat first
robot(s) with a life expectancy of less than 10 minutes
robot(s) that are so fire-breathing they toast

robot(s) that are so dangerous they need a human in the middle

robot(s) that are so dangerous you have to click a link to get to the wikipedia entry about them

robot(s) that are so dangerous you have to hover your mouse over them to see the wikipedia entry

robot(s) that are so dangerous your eyeballs will pop out if you look closely enough
====================

the neural net generated dialogues are between humans, not AI
====================
A few notes on the AI learning process:
====================
I am thinking of doing something like this:
====================
the whole dataset + more are available to browse through the Machine Learning API here:
====================
The neural network trained on  already has a pretty good idea what humans are thinking.
(
====================
This is one reason why machine learning algorithms are prone to bias: technically, they're interpreting the world the way we do, but we're just as liable to accidentally click on the "show more" button.

I'm just now getting my hands on the final game, but already it is one of my favorite series. Excerpt here:
====================
One thing I love about this project is how it's using existing models and textures. It generated full-bleed human breasts and a baker's dozen other body types.
====================
I think my favorite part is the extended vocabulary.

Ooh, I love this. The neural net's gonna love this. #WorfTheSlug

I am, of course, not joking about the fractal cocktail. I had fun writing about it.

It looks eerily like a neural net you might recognize from 's text-based AI.
It might even be  's voice.

I trained a neural network to generate Alice in Wonderland stories. Here are a few of my favorites.
====================
go ahead and say hi to  or  at your peril
====================
The neural network would do well to steer clear of the following situations:
1. Baby bottles
2. Inappropriate cooking utensils
3. Inappropriate near-sightedness
4. Inappropriate dancing

The bot also learned from answers given by humans. 

It learned to generate the  line by line answer.

Here are the top 5. 

Glad the neural net is on our side!
====================
I think my absolute favorite part is the level of detailed planning it required. From the tiny details of the neural network's hand, to the many, many tiny details of the human hand, to the many, many tics. Such planning discipline and planning discipline translated to planning all manner of other things, e.g. food, water, etc.

My favorite part of this is the faces.

The neural net did not make the neural net's art, but it did learn to generate crap that the real artist wanted to show off.
The resulting  pieces are strangely unsettling.
====================
As far as I can tell, this neural net generated pub names are ... untrustworthy
====================
I should note that while neural networks are great at generating new animals, there are some species that are just plain hard to breed.

In particular, this is one of them.
====================
I think the caveman mode stuff is getting a little too real for some reason
====================
I am thinking of ways to do this. Yours probably not doing a WHOLE post like this. >:

It looks so cozy! 
Is that a tiny Vader throw sheet, or has it somehow printed itself onto the sheet too?
====================
There are so many gems in the raw neural net output here  
(the best part is the stitching itself)

I am thinking themed - a hint: lemon is a good one

This looks really good, & it was trained on very large corpora. Excerpt below:
====================
I'm just now getting into StoryMaker, but already it looks eerily on-brand for an AI.

Plus, it's GM!
====================
The neural network trained on  already has a good handle on the series of events that lead up to that one.

In fact, the series of events seems to have been predicted by the  model.

The  neural network   are remarkably similar in many ways - they just happen to have learned from one much earlier document.

Even though they're incredibly different in many ways, they seem to share a certain amount of commonality.

It could be that the similarities end up pointing us to the same underlying model - which is itself a model we already have.
